# Geometric_Shapes
In this program we will create a program that will draw some geometric shapes and equations on a coordinate system. The geometric shapes are rectangles and triangles. The equations that we will create are lines, parabola and circle. While creating these shapes and equations we ask the user first to choose which shape or equation they want to create on the coordinate system. After we know which shape or equation they want, we ask the user for some values to create a shape or equation they want to see.
